The file FPN contains the implementation of fast projected-Newton like method proposed in [1].

[1] J.-F. Cai, J. V. de Miranda Cardoso, D. P. Palomar, and J. Ying, "Fast Projected Newton-like Method for Precision Matrix Estimation under Total Positivity", accepted in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), New Orleans, LA, USA, Dec. 2023.

The file Data contains the egde list of the underlying graph. You could also directly import the sample covariance matrix or data matrix, then modify the code correspondingly. 

Run BA_P5000_experiments.m to generate the data and run the experiments.
