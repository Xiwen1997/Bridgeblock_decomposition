Matlab, R, and python implementations on how to use bridge-block decomposition to acclerate the learning of large-scale sparse MTP2 Gaussian graphical models proposed in [1]. 

[1] Xiwen Wang, Jiaxi Ying, and Daniel P. Palomar, 'Learning Large-Scale MTP2 Gaussian Graphical Models via Bridge-Block Decomposition,' accepted in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), New Orleans, LA, USA, Dec. 2023.

The proposed framework decomposes the optimal solution via the bridge-block structure of the thresholded graph. The methods could significantly accelerate the convergence of existing algroithms and reduce memory cost.
